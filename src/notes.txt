important request- when a drawing is made, it's position is currently registered statically when saved. If the <Video> element get resized the drawing doesn't.
It's imperative that the drawing's size remains relative to the video's apsect ratio, so if it's 16:9 it should stay relative and anchored to that, 1:1 anchored to that etc...

featureRequest- create a functional component that adds an "i" icon to appBar , when click diplay a window vertically and horziontally centered displaying all the video's metadata. this component will be written in a new page and imported to this one.
