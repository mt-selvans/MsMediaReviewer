feature_1#-(if the folder containing the index.html file has a JSON file containing
            `MsMediaReview` automatically import those comments.
            if there are several `MsMediaReview` open the one with the latest date and time. Is it possible to override such JSON file with new save each time user saves?)

HOW SHOULD YOU OPERATE
Please keep everything tidy, easy to understand and compressed whenever .map methods are practical, implement them to avoid repeating code
please confirm that you have addressed each issue listed because you are skipping them
write the WHOLE UPDATED CODE please ensuring you don't break anything.
If a comment hast `DD` (don't delete) please don't delete it
IT'S IMPERATIVE YOU WRITE THE WHOLE UPDATED CODE, BEFORE STARTING WRITING ANYTHING PLEASE CONFIRM ME YOU'LL WRITE THE WHOLE UPDATED CODE WITHOUT SKIPPING A SINGLE LINE
I DON'T WANT ANY `...REST OF THE CODE` i WANT ALL THE UPDATED CODE
